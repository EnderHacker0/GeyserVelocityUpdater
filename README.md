# GeyserVelocityUpdater
A script that updates Geyser-Velocity automatically

**This script does not restart Velocity for you.**

How to use:

1. Modify the code: You should edit lines with descriptions (//).
   jar_file: Where you want the geyser jar file to be. It must be a specific file, not directory. Must be in the plugins directory.
   version_file: Where you want the txt file that stores version number to be stored. Can be anywhere you can access.
   interval: Located at the bottom. How many seconds should the program wait before checking for update another time?
2. Delete your old geyser jar file.
3. Create a txt file at version_file and write anything in the first line.
4. Compile the code, install dependencies and run.
